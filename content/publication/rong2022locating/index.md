abstract: "Continuity and steadiness are vital for services with massive users, which requires the anomalies of services should be detected and resolved in a timely manner. Our previous work proposed a tool, namely *ImpAPTr (Impact Analysis based on Pruning Tree)*, to identify the combination of multiple dimensional attributes as the clues leading to the root cause of service anomalies. However, *ImpAPTr* applies a threshold driven strategy, i.e. it needs to be triggered by a ≥ 0.05% drop of the success rate of the service calls (abbr. *SRSC*), which may face problems in an atypical yet pervasive situation in field application. For example, the combination of trivial anomalies (i.e. each causes a drop less than 0.05% to *SRSC*) can lead to a far more than 0.05% drop on *SRSC*. Besides, a suitable threshold is usually hard to be determined, etc. To address these problems, we propose a new method, namely *ImpAPTr+* in this paper to free the constraint of the 0.05% threshold. The basic idea is to involve time dimension and identify clues across multiple time intervals of data. We performed evaluation on three typical methods (i.e. *ImpAPTr+*, *R-Adtributor* and *Squeeze*) with both production environment dataset and simulation dataset. The former dataset is directly retrieved from the service monitoring data in *Meituan*, one of the largest on-line service providers worldwide. The latter dataset is fabricated also using the monitoring data from the same company. The results indicate: (1) *ImpAPTr+* outperforms previous approaches to a large degree in terms of accuracy. (2) Both *ImpAPTr+* and *R-Adtributor* are able to find proper clues within seconds. (3) *ImpAPTr+* tends to find proper clues with shorter time intervals (i.e. less data), which implies that the method is more suitable for near real-time monitoring scenarios."
